# Spatial prediction and assessment in real time

## Based on previously presented theory, we can summarize the usual PSM processes as:

    Preparation of point data (training data).

    Preparation of covariate data (the explanatory variables).

    Model fitting and validation (building rules by overlay, model fitting and cross-validation).

    Prediction and generation of (currently best-possible) final maps (applying the rules).

    Archiving and distribution of maps (usually via soil geographical databases and/or web services).

    Updates and improvements (support).
